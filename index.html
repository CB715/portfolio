    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Carl, I'm 37 years old and currently live in Leeds with my partner and 2 chlidren. I currently work as a Complaint Manager for a large retail bank. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming, binge watching TV shows and a few occasional visits to the gym.</p>
    <p>I've always had an interest in coding, I've previously experienced Delphi, Pascal and a little html, but have not had the confidence to undertake learning formally. I'm now ready to go a new direction in life and will hopefully make it as a junior developer.</p>
